           During my academic journey, I have demonstrated excellence in both sports and personal development. At the collegiate level, I showcased my volleyball prowess by winning three tournaments. In school, I was an integral part of our team that triumphed in the prestigious National Level Lagore Championship. My versatility extends beyond traditional sports; I received recognition for my skills in various esports teams. Additionally, I was honored with a medal for all-round development during my intermediate studies, reflecting my commitment to holistic growth.

            Apart from volleyball and esports, I have actively participated in a range of sports, including shuttle, cricket, and swimming, further highlighting my diverse athletic abilities.
